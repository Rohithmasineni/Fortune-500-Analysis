# Fortune-500-Analysis
## Fortune 500 Analysis (Power BI Dashboard ‚Äì 2024 Data)

üìå Project Overview:

This project presents a detailed Power BI dashboard analysing Fortune 500 companies (2024 data) based on Revenue, Profit, Employee Count, and Assets. It helps visualize business insights, trends, and comparisons across various financial metrics.

### Data Extraction & Preparation

To ensure real-world relevance, I scraped the data from the Fortune 500 website using Python's Beautiful Soup. The extracted dataset included key metrics such as Rank, Company Name, Revenues, Profits, Profit Margin, Assets, Employees, and Revenue Growth.
After extraction, I cleaned and structured the data using Pandas and NumPy to make it analysis-ready.
